    <p class="p-items">In the game, items are categorized into currency and cosmetics. There are two types of currency: silver coins and gold coins. Silver coins can be earned through matches, daily sign-ins, and achievement unlocks, and can be used to purchase
    various outfits, emotes, and character banners. Gold coins, on the other hand, are obtained through daily sign-ins, playing the claw machine, or by making in-game purchases. In addition to everything silver coins can buy, gold coins can
    also be used to purchase pets that float alongside the player, which provide additional silver coin rewards during matches.</p>
    <p class="p-items">When completing various tasks, players can also earn gears in different colors, which can be used to unlock a variety of
    unique kill effects.</p>
