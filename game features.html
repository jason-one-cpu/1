    <p>After starting the game, players are divided into three factions: Geese, Ducks, and Neutral.</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>Faction</td>
            <td>Description</td>

        <tr>
            <td>Ducks</td>
            <td>Ducks are the bad guys who gain sabotage abilities through completing sabotage tasks. Teammates’ names appear in red in the Ducks’ view. Ducks can perform Goose tasks, but this does not advance the Geese’s progress. Ducks win by killing the Geese or completing certain sabotage tasks.</td>

        </tr>
    </table>
    <p class="p-features">When a Duck kills a player from the Goose faction, they experience a cooldown before being able to kill again, while Geese leave a corpse upon death. <br>When a Goose finds a corpse, they can press R to report it, triggering a meeting where players discuss who might be a Duck. After everyone speaks, players can vote to eject a player.</p>
    <p class="p-features">Additionally, each map has a public alarm point (marked by a small bell) where players can ring to call a meeting, though there are limitations and cooldowns per round.</p>
    <b class="title-b">Hidden Achievements</b>
    <p class="p-features">The game store offers five locked hats and twelve outfits, which are tied to specific achievements. After unlocking an
    achievement, players still need to purchase the item.</p>
